# Quantum Vault Nexus - Crypto Suite Architecture

This document outlines the architecture and implementation plan for the Quantum Vault Nexus crypto suite.

## System Components

### 1. Core Mining Engine
- Based on libxmrig for optimal performance
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS)
- Dynamic binary selection based on platform detection
- Verification of binary integrity and authenticity

### 2. Desktop Application (Electron + React)
- **Mining Features**
  - Pool configuration and connection management
  - Thread allocation and mining algorithm selection
  - Real-time hash rate monitoring
  - Performance optimization based on system resources
  
- **Wallet Features**
  - BIP-39 mnemonic phrase generation and management
  - Secure key storage using OS-native security features
  - Transaction history with filtering and sorting
  - QR code generation for easy receiving
  - Address book management

### 3. Mobile Application (React Native)
- **Mining Features**
  - Battery-aware mining profiles
  - Thermal management to prevent overheating
  - Background mining with notification controls
  
- **Wallet Features**
  - Mobile-optimized UI for transaction management
